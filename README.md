# Github-Lab2

This is the repository containing the machine learning models for the cancer dataset. Link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

The main objective of this project was to perform the basic git operations to be confortable with the version control tools.
So, using gitbash, there have been added the files and pushed to the remote.

To use the Logistic and RF models, this repo can be forked by the user and can work on that easily.

Thanks!
